# Backend Usage

using Nitro Server Engine, we will make an api route that recieves the files and stores them in the folder `userFiles`

since we have two methods of uploading from the frontend there will be also two methods of handling the request from the backend

::alert{type="warning"}
Beware of writing the same file name to the same location, [here is why](/introduction/backend-usage#updating-files).
::

## Multipart Object Method

open a new api route: `/server/api/file.ts`
::code-group
```ts [Single File]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
	const files = (await readMultipartFormData(event)) || []

	const fileName = await storeFile(
        files[0],    // the file object
        12,          // you can add a name for the file or length of Unique ID that will be automatically generated!
        '/userFiles' // the folder the file will be stored in
    )

	return fileName
})
```

```ts [Multiple Files]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
	const files = (await readMultipartFormData(event)) || []
	const fileNames: string[] = []

	for (const file of files) {
		fileNames.push(
            await storeFile(
                file,        // the file object
                'fileName',  // you can add a name for the file or length of Unique ID that will be automatically generated!
                '/userFiles' // the folder the file will be stored in
            )
        )
	}

	return fileNames
})
```
::

::callout
#summary
`storeFile` will return the name of the file that was stored

#content
---
Storing with the random title generator will return the name of the file

Example code:
`await storeFileFormData(file, 8, '/userFiles')`

Example of what it will return: `"f09Riodv.png"`

---

Storing with a custom name will return the file name including the extension: `fileName.png`

## JSON Method

::code-group
```ts [Single File]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    const { files } = await readBody<{ files: File[] }>(event)

    const fileName = await storeFileJson(
        files[0],     // the file object
        8,            // you can add a name for the file or length of Unique ID that will be automatically generated!
        '/userFiles'  // the folder the file will be stored in
    )

    return fileName
})

interface File {
    name: string
    size: number
    type: string
    lastModified: date,
    content: string,
}
```

```ts [Multiple Files]
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { files } = await readBody<{ files: File[] }>(event)
    const fileNames: string[] = []

    for (const file of files) {
        fileNames.push(await storeFileJson(
            file,         // the file object
            8,            // you can add a name for the file or length of Unique ID that will be automatically generated!
            '/userFiles'  // the folder the file will be stored in
        ))
  }

    return fileNames
})

interface File {
    name: string
    size: number
    type: string
    lastModified: date,
    content: string,
}
```
::

### Get File Data
If you need to get the data of the file without storing it you can use the `parseDataUrl` Method
```ts
const { binaryString, ext } = parseDataUrl(file.content)
```

::alert{type="warning"}
This function only works for Base64 files "the JSON method"

## Updating Files
if you want to update a file you just have to store a new file with the **same name** and it will automatically write the new file content to the same file title
