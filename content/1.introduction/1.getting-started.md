# Getting Started

Here is a simple guide to setting up **Nuxt File Storage** in your project.

## Play online

You can play with Nuxt File Storage in your browser using Stackblitz:

## Add to your project

1. Go to your project and type in:

```bash [bash]
npx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-file-storage
```

2. add `nuxt-file-storage` to your modules:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['nuxt-file-storage'],
})
```

3. add the absolute `mount` location:

::code-group
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['nuxt-file-storage'],
    fileStorage: {
        mount: process.env.mount
    },
})
```

```ts [.env]
mount='/home/$USR/development/your-nuxt-app/server/files'
```

You should definitely use Environment Variables `.env` instead of hard-coding your mount to differentiate between local development and deployment and to not expose your file system structure to your project.
